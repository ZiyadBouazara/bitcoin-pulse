## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Bitcoin Pulse. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

#### How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started the Bitcoin Pulse, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Bitcoin Pulse otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Bitcoin Pulse's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Bitcoin Pulse
- Enable a sustainable system for Bitcoin Pulse's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Make sure you are following all the guidelines in the [code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>
3. While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
